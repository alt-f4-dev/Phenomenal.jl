# Phenomenal.jl

Phenomenal.jl is a physics-constrained inverse-inference framework for discovering generative models from the topological and spectral structure of neutron scattering datasets.

## Scope
- Elastic diffraction preprocessing and indexing
- Inelastic spectral classification via topological descriptors
- Forward-model bridges (Sunny.jl, Phunny.jl)
- Constraint-aware model-space search

## Status
Active research code. API is unstable.
